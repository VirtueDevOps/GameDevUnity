# GameDevUnity
This code creates a Town class that represents a town in the game. The Town class has a name, an array of buildings, and a list of NPCs that live in the town. The Town class also has InitializeTown and UpdateTown methods that are used to initialize and update the town and its buildings and NPCs.

You can use this code as a starting point for creating a town in your game, and customize it to fit the needs of your specific game. For example, you could add more properties and methods to the Town class to represent additional features of the town, such as shops, quests, and events. You could also create additional classes to represent buildings, NPCs, and other game objects in your town.
